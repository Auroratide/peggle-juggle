# Peggle Juggle

A simple game made for [GMTK Game Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021) around the theme "Joined Together". Balloons are trying to escape your pegboard, and you must stop them with rubber bands!

## Instructions

Click and drag on pegs to place rubber bands. That's all you have to do! The game is over once all balloons on the field pop by going off screen.
