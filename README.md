# Rubber Juggle

A simple game made for [GMTK Game Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021) around the theme "Joined Together". Balloons are trying to escape your pegboard, and you must stop them with rubber bands!

[Play the game on itch.io](https://auroratide.itch.io/rubber-juggle), or read more [on my website](https://auroratide.com/portfolio/rubber-juggle).

## Instructions

Click and drag on pegs to place rubber bands. That's all you have to do! The game is over once all balloons on the field pop by going off screen.

## Ideas If I Had Time

* Entry animations for balloons - to indicate to players where a balloon is about to spawn for the sake of planning
* Test limiting the number of bands - unsure if this would have been funner
* Score indicator on each bounce - seeing the little number light up is feedback to the player
* Obviously, inclusion of a tutorial
* Tweaking the difficulty curve - fine tune all the timing stuff to maximize fun
* Loosen band placement - on mobile it's easy to accidentally miss the peg
* Stop overlapping pegs - currently, pegs have a (low) chance of overlapping, which doesn't seem to be a problem but is potentially concerning
* Different colored balloons
* Indicate the newest peg somehow
